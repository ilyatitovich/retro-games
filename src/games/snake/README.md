# Ideas

| **Levels / Stages** | Add progressively harder stages (new speed, obstacles, smaller map, more food types) | Keeps players engaged and adds long-term progression |
| **Obstacles** | Static or dynamic walls that appear as you level up | Adds complexity and forces strategic movement |
| **Power-ups** | Temporary effects like slow-motion, bonus points, invincibility | Introduces variety and risk-reward |
| **Multiple Game Modes** | e.g. Classic, Timed, Survival, Reverse controls | Increases replayability and audience reach |
| **Dynamic Map** | Shrinking boundaries, rotating maze layouts | Breaks predictability and adds challenge |

| **Smooth Animations** | Use easing, snake slither effect, food popping | Makes the game feel alive |
| **Grid Effects** | Visual feedback when eating, dying, or changing speed | Clear player feedback loop |
| **Responsive Canvas** | Scales to screen size, mobile-first controls | Widens accessibility and polish |
